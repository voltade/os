message: Only drizzle `db` calls can be awaited in PLv8 functions.
note: |
  PLv8 does not have a event loop, exceptions thrown by awaited promises will not stop the execution of the subsequent code. So awaiting promises in PLv8 functions is not allowed.

  As for drizzle `db` calls, our custom build script converts asynchronous `await db.select().xxx()` to synchronous `db.select().xxx().execute()`, and remove all `async` and `await` keywords from the bundled code.
